Config shadow build path before building nya engine lib to avoid building in nya-engine/build directory.

Include 'link_nya_engine.pri' file in custom qt project using nya-engine, this pri file links nya engine library to current project.
Example:
    NYA_ENGINE_DIR = /ext/sdk/nya-engine
    include($${NYA_ENGINE_DIR}/build/qt5/link_nya_engine.pri)
